To be used as a guide, will fluctuate day to day as work needs

1. **0930** - Previous cohort/team standup
	1. shared learning
	2. ideas sharing
	3. shared unblocking


2. **1000** - JAMA PC standup
	1. completed items
	2. plans for the day
	3. new items to add
	4. items to remove

7. **1700** - daily roundup
	1. completed items
	2. plans for the day
	3. new items to add
	4. items to remove
	5. any issues?


**Quality** for the group is:
- understandable code
- fully functional to the MVP - or above if time
- looks nice as well

Maybe we need to consider:
- Usability
- Accessibility
- Security
- Testability
- Longevity

**Work Products**
- requirements - MVP?
	- 
- user stories
	- Users can comment on posts
	- Users can like posts and the number of likes is visible next to the post
	- Users can upload photos and see them just like posts
	- A user's name and a little photo of them appears next to their posts
- specifications


**Documentation**
- 


Ask "what if...?"
- Quality discussed, defined?
	- discuss this early on for some sort of shared idea, what matters? what is important?
	- product related
	- and otherwise


- 'Work products' - requirements, user stories, specifications
- what were some of the ways of working we changed last time that we could do from the start this time?
	- README
	- Documentation
	- CICD
- Agreed purpose
- processes
	- do they have processes
	- when do we meet
	- where do bugs go
		- preference is on TRELLO
	- do we pair off, do we split tests and devs
	- do we pair with devs
	- (if you ever feel like you dunno what you're doing or working on, process might help)
- Trello/ticket board - clear useful agreed
- communication streams - do we do videos, do we do docs, github or what
- testability - frameworks, technologies etc
	- observability (o11y)
- planning for 
	- test work products
	- test cases
	- test data
	- ideas on how to test
	- tools
		- like the accessibility ones
			- WAVE
			- lighthouse
		- or the ZAP bits
- Decision table
	- wireframe
	- state diagrams
	- process
	- test cases from that kinda
